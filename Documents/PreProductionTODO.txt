Research:

- Review and rating for TTML & output
	- Dynamic scale
	- 10x rating 0 - 10 = score out of 100
- A / B testing
	- Suitable to a variety of tasks (comparing two sets of output with different LLM params)
	- Use "Review and rating" to determine the better option
- Fully automated TTML change A/B test
	- A proposed update can be submitted for an automated review process
- Recursive self-improvement
	- Combine all of the above

1. Integrate Open AI *DONE*

2. Set up data structure for holding TCXML (in isolated C# lib) *DONE*

3. Set up importing and exporting TCXML from file to data.
	- Add JSON import/export option
	
4. Create code to execute a TCXML
	
5. Test run a TCXML

6. Integrate local LLM

7. Integrate tools (e.g image generation)

8. Figure out how to make C# lib for running TCXML run on AWS

9. Make scheduled job in AWS to run daily.

10. Make AWS job automatically add to test website

11. Create automated AI comic strip website


Stretch Goals:

- Redefine operations 
	- Make TC / new TCXML determination clearer.
	- Make them able to reference existing TCXMLs

- Create a switch in TCXML (inc. GOTO)
	- Switch logic could be another TCXML
